Emotion Detection using CNN (NNDL Project)

Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning (NNDL) course.  
The aim is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial expressions into 7 different emotions:
Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise.

Project Structure
NNDL Project/
- data/train/<7 emotion folders>
- data/test/<7 emotion folders>
- train.py (CNN training script)
- predict.py (Predict emotion for a single image)
- emotion_model.h5 (Saved trained model)
- labels.npy (Saved label dictionary)
- training_graphs.png (Accuracy & loss graph)
- test_image.jpg (Test image)
- README.md (Documentation)

Installation & Setup
1. Create Conda Environment:
conda create -n nndl python=3.9 -y
conda activate nndl

2. Install Required Libraries:
pip install tensorflow==2.10
pip install numpy==1.23.5
pip install matplotlib
pip install opencv-python
pip install scikit-learn

Dataset
Use FER-2013 or any 7-class facial emotion dataset.
Folder structure must be:
data/train/<emotion>/
data/test/<emotion>/

Training the Model
Run:
python train.py

This will:
- Train a CNN
- Validate model
- Save emotion_model.h5
- Save labels.npy
- Generate accuracy/loss graphs

Predicting Emotion for a New Image
Place your test image as test_image.jpg
Run:
python predict.py
Output example:
Predicted Emotion: happy

Model Performance
Training Accuracy: ~70–75%
Validation Accuracy: ~55–60%

Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- CNN

Applications
- Emotion Classification
- Sentiment Analysis
- Academic NNDL Project

Limitations
- Works best on cropped face images
- Might misclassify subtle expressions
- No real-time webcam detection
- No MobileNetV2 upgrade included
